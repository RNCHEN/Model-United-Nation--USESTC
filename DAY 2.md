collect resource && assessment --teacher and device

collect:

- teacher
	- It's better to train the local teacher
  While the language problem is the most trouble problem, training the local teacher can be a better solution than foreign teachers.
	
	- The training is not complicated
	
	  we don't need the high academic-level teachers, and the primary school teachers can meet the standard.
	
	- The exited funding system should distribute
	
- device

  - Digital device owns the highest priority

    The online education can relieve the impact of COVID-19. The digital device is the basement of distance education

  - UNESCO should distribute

  - Nations like China could create factories, sharing the technology. The company could develop and local people can find the job.

assessment:

- when they return to school

  Many used email or digital communication apps to stay in  touch with their school. While this is promising, it is unclear how these efforts influenced  children’s learning. Assessing children’s potential learning loss as they return to school will  be crucial to identify areas for support and remediation.
