*The development of digital technology gives new opportunities for cultural heritage conservation. However, some people may think that the excessive application of digital technology may destroy the essence and core of cultural heritage.*

 

What do you think is the limitation of the application of digital technologies in the conservation of cultural heritage? You may write a small essay to show your thoughts. 

Sure, here are some limitations of the application of digital technologies:

1. Accessibility: Not everyone has access to digital technologies, which can create a digital divide between those who have access to these technologies and those who do not.

2. Dependence: Over-reliance on digital technologies can lead to a loss of basic skills such as reading, writing, and critical thinking, as well as a loss of social skills and human interaction.   and money!!

3. Technological obsolescence: Digital technologies can become outdated quickly, leading to the need for frequent updates and replacements, which can be costly. Reliance on electricity and internet connectivity: The effective use of digital technologies depends on access to reliable electricity and internet connectivity, which may not be available in all areas or during power outages.

4. Environmental impact: The production and disposal of digital technologies can have a significant impact on the environment, contributing to electronic waste and the depletion of natural resources.

5. Social and ethical issues: Digital technologies can have a significant impact on society and can raise ethical concerns, such as the use of AI for decision making, the potential for job displacement due to automation, and the impact of social media on mental health.

> some countries do not agree the digital equipment to get in 

6. Bias and discrimination: Digital technologies can be biased and discriminatory, reflecting the biases and values of their **designers and developers**, which can perpetuate inequalities and reinforce social stereotypes.

7. Overload of information: The use of digital technologies can lead to an overload of information, which can be overwhelming and make it difficult to identify relevant information.



The digital technology has changed people's lifestyle deeply, which you can see from the way in study, entertaining, trip as well as the cultural heritage. In the past, we can do nothing but witness the disappear of the valuable heritage( eg.). However, people can use the digital technology to record the weak(学习) heritage like the Palace Museum. We can read from the news that

Nevertheless, we can not use the digital technology without limitation. 

Because of some disadvantages, we must be aware of something. 



1. The restriction on the use. To be more specific, not all people can use the digital device, which sometimes are much more expensive than one ticket. As we know that people can cost 30 rmb to visit a museum, but they need pay much more to buy a mobile phone. If the museum pay more efforts on the digital technology, they can not be sure of the quality of the physic visit. 

   For example. if the museum spend the money on the development of mini program on the wechat or record some scene to build a VR model, they will have less money to update the file of some exhibits. What's more, the museum will have less chance to make some advertisements, which sometimes are the core factor to attract people from the outside. You can imagine that if you see some elegant and attractive pictures on the short video, you will probably choose to visit the destination of those pictures instead of other places. 

   

   

2.  Over-reliance on digital technologies can lead to a loss of basic skills such as speaking as well as a loss of social skills and human interaction.  That's because if the staff are get used to the play the recorded video to replace the explaining, as many museum people can see now, they will make some mistakes like forgetting some important details or will be embarrassed when encounter some accidents. 

   For example, last time when I have a visit on the Sichuan Museum, the staff just give all people one mobile phone, which record some voice file that can be played. During the whole visiting, the staff just give us the number of voice file and say nothing but ask us to learn from the voice file. All things are recorded and what the stuff need to do is to guide us to walk around the museum without saying any words. To be honest, that's a bad experience. When I ask the staff some questions about the exhibits, he just said I can find all answers in that mobile phone, even if I did not find finally. As you can see from my experience, using the digital device without limitations will decrease people's love about our heritage to some extend. 

3. Environmental impact: The using and disposal of digital technologies can have a significant impact on the environment, contributing to electronic waste and the depletion of natural resources. That sounds impossible as people do not contact to the cultural heritage directly and what the techniques do is to take some photos, which does not harm anything. However, the truth is that some cultural heritage are much more fragile than we thought. 

   For example, the Dunhuang frescoes. People indeed know that those frescoes can not be touched as the grease on the finger would make corrosion. However, the fact is that the light from the camera would have the negative impact on the ingredient. Co2 will cause the oxidation and blackening of the murals, According to the news reported by the ChinaDaily, it is the infrared ray and ultraviolet ray in the flash have energy, which will break the fiber in the organic material.

So, to protect the cultural heritage, we must limit some digital technology that will make the negative impact but try to develop new technology that has no harm. 



The advancement of digital technology has undoubtedly brought about significant changes to various aspects of our lives, including the way we learn, entertain, travel, and even appreciate cultural heritage. Thanks to digital technology, we now have the ability to preserve and record invaluable cultural heritage, such as the Palace Museum. According to a recent news report by China Daily, the Palace Museum in Beijing has launched a new project that utilizes advanced digital technology to record and preserve the intricate details of its cultural relics. This project not only allows people to appreciate these cultural relics in unprecedented ways but also helps to safeguard them for future generations.

However, it's essential to recognize that digital technology should be used with caution and limitations. Digital technology sometimes can have a significant negative impact on cultural heritage. Because of some disadvantages, we must be aware of something. 

The restrictions on the use of digital devices means that not all people can benefit from them, as they can often be much more expensive than a museum ticket. While a visit to a museum may cost only 30 RMB, purchasing a mobile phone can cost much more. If a museum puts more effort into digital technology, they cannot guarantee the quality of the physical visit.

For example, if a museum spends money on developing a mini-program on WeChat or creating a VR model of some scenes, they may have less money to update exhibits or invest in other areas that enhance visitors' experience. Furthermore, if the museum invests less in advertising, they may struggle to attract visitors from outside. For instance, seeing elegant and attractive pictures on social media may influence people to visit those places instead of other museums or exhibitions.

It is essential for museums to consider balancing the use of digital technology and the traditional physical visit to ensure they provide a high-quality experience for all visitors, regardless of their access to digital devices.

Over-reliance on digital technologies in museums can lead to a loss of basic skills, such as speaking, and a lack of social interaction. This can result in staff members becoming overly reliant on recorded videos to replace the traditional practice of verbally explaining exhibits. This over-reliance can lead to mistakes and embarrassment, as staff may forget important details or encounter accidents during the exhibition.

For instance, during a recent visit to the Sichuan Museum, staff members provided visitors with a mobile phone containing pre-recorded audio files for each exhibit. Throughout the visit, the staff provided no explanation and only directed visitors to listen to the audio files. This experience was unsatisfactory, and visitors were left feeling disconnected from the museum and its exhibits. When visitors asked questions about the exhibits, the staff simply directed them back to the audio files, without providing any additional information or insight. This over-reliance on digital technology without limitations can decrease people's appreciation for our cultural heritage to some extent.

It is crucial for museums to strike a balance between using digital technology and maintaining the traditional practice of verbal explanation. Staff members should be trained to provide informative and engaging verbal explanations, which can enhance visitors' understanding and appreciation of exhibits. In addition, while digital technology can be a useful tool, it should not replace human interaction and social skills, which are fundamental to the museum experience. Overall, it is essential for museums to use digital technology to enhance the visitor experience while also preserving the fundamental aspects of museum visits.

Some current digital technology in museums can have significant environmental impacts, including contributing to electronic waste and depleting natural resources. While some may argue that digital technologies do not directly contact cultural heritage, the truth is that some cultural heritage is incredibly fragile and susceptible to damage from technology use.

One example is the Dunhuang frescoes, which are known to be incredibly delicate and must not be touched due to the risk of corrosion from the grease on human fingers. However, the use of cameras and other digital technologies can also pose a threat to these invaluable artifacts. Research has shown that the light emitted by cameras can cause negative impacts on the frescoes, including the oxidation and blackening of the murals.

According to reports from the ChinaDaily, it is the infrared and ultraviolet rays present in camera flashes that have the energy to break the fiber in the organic material, leading to significant damage over time. To protect cultural heritage, it is essential to limit the use of digital technologies that pose a risk to these delicate artifacts. Instead, museums should invest in developing new, more environmentally-friendly technologies that can capture and preserve cultural heritage without causing harm.

Furthermore, it is crucial to address the issue of electronic waste generated by digital technologies used in museums. Proper disposal and recycling of digital equipment should be a priority to reduce the environmental impact and preserve natural resources. As technology continues to advance, museums must prioritize sustainability and find ways to integrate digital technologies without harming the environment or cultural heritage.
